We all know the infamous King Henry VIII and his six wives. But when you sit a history quiz, their
names and fate simply escape your mind!

Create a function which will enable you to return the correct wife and correct fate when their number (1-6)
is entered into the function, in the following format:

"Wife number: <wifeNumber>, Wife name: <wifeName>, Wife fate: <wifeFate>"

1 - Catherine of Aragon (Divorced)
2 - Anne Boleyn (Beheaded)
3 - Jane Seymour (Died)
4 - Anne of Cleves (Divorced)
5 - Katherine Howard (Beheaded)
6 - Katherine Parr (Survived)

For function arguments other than 1-6, the function should return the message "Not a number between 1-6, try again"
